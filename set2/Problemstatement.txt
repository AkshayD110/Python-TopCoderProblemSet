Problem Statement
    	Elly has two strings of the same length: A and B. Now she wants to transform A into an anagram of B by changing some of its letters. The only operation the girl can make is to increment some (possibly none or all) characters in A. E.g., she can change an 'A' to a 'B', or a 'K' to an 'L'. She can increment each character arbitrarily many times. E.g., she can increment an 'A' three times to get a 'D'. The incrementation is cyclic: if she increments a 'Z', she gets an 'A' again.



For example, she can transform "ELLY" to "KRIS" character by character by shifting 'E' to 'K' (6 operations), 'L' to 'R' (again 6 operations), the second 'L' to 'I' (23 operations, going from 'Z' to 'A' on the 15-th operation), and finally 'Y' to 'S' (20 operations, again cyclically going from 'Z' to 'A' on the 2-nd operation). The total number of operations would be 6 + 6 + 23 + 20 = 55. However, to make "ELLY" an anagram of "KRIS" it would be better to change it to "IRSK" with only 29 operations.



You are given the Strings A and B. Find the minimal number of operations needed to transform A into some other string X, such that X is an anagram of B.

Definition

Class:	EllysAnagrams
Method:	getCount
Parameters:	String, String
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int getCount(String A, String B)
(be sure your method is public)


Notes
-	We call two strings X and Y anagrams of each-other if we can re-arrange the letters in one of them to get the other.

Constraints
-	A and B will be between 1 and 50 characters long.
-	A and B will have the same length.
-	A and B will contain only uppercase letters from the English alphabet ('A'-'Z').

Examples
0)


"ELLY"

"KRIS"

Returns: 29

The example from the problem statement.
1)


"TOPCODER"

"TCOINDIA"

Returns: 57

Several of the letters are present in both strings.
2)


"HARDEST"

"THREADS"

Returns: 0

The first string is already an anagram of the second.
3)


"AAAAAAAAAA"

"ZZZZZZZZZZ"

Returns: 250

Some strings may require many operations.
4)


"AWIODJGWAMBAUWNMQEROAIQWYRZSVEPTT"

"BNSIAELDALCGAWOPIWEQTYCNAZEKJXVYU"

Returns: 105

Random keystrokes.
